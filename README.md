# Food-Access-Using-ArcGIS
Comprehensive data analytics project identifying factors influencing residents' access to 
grocery stores or other food sources without a car and identifying neighborhoods or 
areas of Charlotte that face limited access to a grocery store. Using ArcGIS, analyzed spatial patterns and Charlotte's infrastructure. Cleaned,
manipulated, and combined data using Python, and created a binary classification 
target variable, 'Lila', to predict if an area has high or low food access based on 
infrastructure and socioeconomic predictor variables.
